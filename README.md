# Contribute
Please feel free to make any suggestions, edits or raise issues. Forks and pull requests are always welcome. I am not likely to maintain the code from here on as I have to move on to other projects.

## Adding new features or fixing bugs
As mentioned above, I am not likely to maintain the code and as such, if you would like to build on this project, you could always fork or clone this repository.

# Feedback
As this was done within a month of learning Javascript, the code is written in a very amateurish manner, so criticism is always appreciated with regard to how I can better write or refactor my code.
